# About This Game

The Hedgehog's Dilemma is a light-hearted game with turn-based combat mechanics aiming to raise awareness about social anxiety, a mental disorder that affects over 150 thousand people in Brazil and countless more globally.

I hope you enjoy playing it!

## About Me

My name is Larissa Fazolin, I'm 21 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Statistics at UNICAMP. I am also enrolled at the Apple Developer Academy in Campinas, Brazil.

One challenge I've always faced is my social anxiety. While it may not always be outwardly apparent (as in my game), it significantly impacts the life of whoever has it. Statistically speaking, over 150 thousand people in Brazil are affected by this disorder, and many more worldwide. Because of that, I aimed to create something that not only entertains but also raises awareness about social anxiety. My goal is to provide a light and enjoyable experience that resonates with those who have social anxiety, while also fostering understanding among those who do not.

## Running the Game on XCode

The game was developed for iPhone and should be played in landscape mode.

Important: The game currently experiences minor lag in the Simulator when any button or navigation link with a sound effect is pressed. This lag does not occur on the iPhone or anywhere else but the Simulator, and I have not been able to find a solution for it. Despite being a bit slower, the experience should be the same :)

## Tools

The game was developed using SwiftUI in Xcode.

I designed all the illustrations and the interface using Figma vectors.
